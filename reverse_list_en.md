### Languaje
Python

### Rules
We can't use any pre build method.

### Solution
We use a while cycle to iterate.
First we should crete the function
We declare the variable
In the while cycle, will start is minor than end they change the values.
To continues iterate, for each iteration, start will add one and end substract one, to continue.
After with return we returns the new invert list.
